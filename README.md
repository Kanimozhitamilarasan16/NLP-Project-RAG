**NLP Project – Document-based Question Answering (RAG)**

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
It allows users to upload documents and ask questions, where answers are generated **based only on the document content**.

This project is built as part of the **PEP NLP prerequisite** and demonstrates practical understanding of:
- Text extraction
- Embeddings
- Semantic search
- Context-aware answering

 Project Objective

To build an **offline, document-aware question answering system** that:
- Reads multiple document formats
- Retrieves relevant content using semantic similarity
- Answers questions based on retrieved context
- Avoids internet-based paid APIs


 Key Features

-  Supports **PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT**
-  Automatic text chunking
-  Semantic search using embeddings
-  Context-based answer generation
-  Fully offline NLP pipeline
-  Academic-friendly and viva-explainable
